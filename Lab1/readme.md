Objective
The objective of Lab 1 was to understand the fundamentals of Git and GitHub, learn how version control works, and practice basic terminal and Git commands. The lab also aimed to introduce Python environment management using pyenv and virtual environments.

What I Learned
In this lab, I learned what version control is and why it is important for tracking changes and collaboration. I understood the difference between Git and GitHub and became familiar with key Git concepts such as repository, commit, clone, push, and pull. I practiced basic Git commands and terminal commands. Additionally, I learned how to manage Python versions and create isolated virtual environments using pyenv.
